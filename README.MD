"My" version of our platterz hack (Yukuan, Arnav and Christina and me)
(the site got changed at 3am for some reason...)

Lessons learnt on my end:
1. usefulness/how to use pyenv/virtualenv
2. django girls is really an OP guide
3. sqlite db are essentially files that can be transported.
4. worked through a real live "migration" => putting stuff on the db
5. found django to be a bit finicky, due to how coupled everything is => trying to merge two django sites together
6. something about the routing...
